##### UX Design Agency

Kosowwwa Digital Agency is passionate about an intuitive user experience because the user is ultimately the one who is the target. We focus on the wants and needs of the user to create stunning solutions through our experience in Research, Strategy, and Design methodologies.

**Research**

By researching users within the guidelines of their environment, and collecting important information about the user to create a well-informed view of the visual experience. Our in-depth product research grows insights and brings light additional strategies. This ensures ease of use of the design, and reduces the need for expensive re-work before an investment is made in development. Ultimately, our methods enable us to innovate empathetically and remain focused on the user.

**Strategy**

Equipped with our research findings, we are able to plan with our clients the most effective path to get to market. Together, we look beyond the boundaries of thinking in terms of features and functions and launch into considering the real holistic needs of the people who will use the product. We employ a combination of strategy tools that can vary according to specific project and client needs. The result is that we establish meaningful user experience strategies for our clients, success metrics, deliverables, and long-term governance.

**Design**

We create digital experiences for any platform that reflect your brand, vision, and end-user needs. Taking the Research and Strategy findings, we start the iterative design process. Through a variety of collaborative techniques we spark not only the creation of individual screens but also generate a consistent and reusable design language as we progress through interaction and visual design. Throughout all of this, we keep the user at the center of every decision. This allows the synthesis of ideas to encapsulate the entire user experience, beyond a single isolated product interaction, and keep it as a set of actions, perceptions, feelings, and emotions that begins the moment a user wakes up to the moment they go to sleep at night.
